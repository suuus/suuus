Hej! I'm Suzanne!
I work at Microsoft as a Developer Productivity Global Blackbelt, covering all of our tooling around Developer Productivity and Platform Engineering from both the GitHub and Microsoft side of the universe.

My passions are Developer Experience, Inner Source, Open Source, and Platform Engineering. A big part of my work is also leveraging AI to help developers build experiences your customers love.
